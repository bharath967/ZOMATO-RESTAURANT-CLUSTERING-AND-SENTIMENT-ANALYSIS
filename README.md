# ZOMATO-RESTAURANT-CLUSTERING-AND-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS



The Project focuses on analyzing the Zomato restaurant data. You have to analyze the sentiments of the 
reviews given by the customer in the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations. 
Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The Analysis also solves some of the business 
cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company 
to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in. This could help in clustering the 
restaurants into segments. Also the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing which can be 
used in cost vs. benefit analysis Data could be used for sentiment analysis. Also the metadata of reviewers 
can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.
To assure Zomato's success it is important for the company to analyze its datasets and make appropriate 
strategic decisions. 

● The problem statement here asks us to cluster the restaurants to help customers find the best restaurants 
in their city and according to their taste and requirement. This will help Zomato in building a good 
recommendation system for their customers. Do a cost-benefit analysis using the cuisines and costs of the 
restaurants.

● It is important to do sentiment analysis to get an idea about how people really feel about a particular 
restaurant and understand the fields they are lagging in. To identify the industry critics and especially work 
on their reviews to build a reputation worth praising.

From elbow method we get 4 number of cluster is best among all.
silhouette score at n_clusters = 4, we get highest silhouette score is 0.47229
By applying different clustering algorithem to our dataset. we get the optimal number of cluster is equal to 

By using logistic regression and random forest regression model on reviews dataset, we get 89% accuracy 
at logistic regression
